    <h1>Spagetti</h1>

     <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
     <p>Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals.</p>

      <p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>RED BELLS PEPPER</li>
        <li>LARGE ROMA TOMATOES</li>
        <li>GARLIC</li>
        <li>ONIONS</li>
        <li>VEGETABLE OIL</li>
        <li>SEASONINGS</li>
        <li>WATER</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>STEPS</strong></p>
      <p>Bring a pan of water to the boil and season it with salt.
        Add the spaghetti and stir it gently until all the strands sink beneath the water level. Stir again to make sure they're not stuck together.
        Cook following the pack instructions but taking 2 mins off the time suggested.
        Check the pasta when the time is up by biting into a strand – it should be cooked through but still firm. Cook for a further 1-2 mins if you need to, or if you prefer your spaghetti softer.
        Drain, reserving a little pasta water to add to the sauce. Add the pasta to the sauce straight away so it doesn’t stick together as it cools.
